# Bangalore House Price Prediction
Bangalore House Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices in Bangalore, India, based on various property features. It is developed as a Jupyter Notebook, providing an end-to-end solution from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization. The dataset used in this project includes information on property characteristics such as location, size, and square footage.
Project Structure
•	Data Preprocessing: The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. It includes steps to clean the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables. Notable preprocessing steps:
o	Feature Engineering: Combines similar features and creates new ones, such as calculating the price per square foot to normalize property values.
o	Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifies and removes outliers in the data to improve model accuracy.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions and relationships between features and the target variable (price). Key insights from EDA include:
o	Distributions of various features such as location, area size, and number of bedrooms.
o	Correlations and trends that influence house prices in Bangalore.
•	Model Building: This section applies multiple machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for house prices, including:
o	Linear Regression
•	Evaluation and Comparison: The models are evaluated based on common regression metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to determine the best-performing model for predicting house prices. The notebook also provides insights into the most important features impacting the predictions.
